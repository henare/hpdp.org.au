<p>Let us all share in our benevolent dictator&#39;s excitement...</p>
<p><i>A return to a 32 comp last night put a smile on the dial of all who attended. Especially that star of my regular email column, Peter T, who yet again knocked out all comers. And a quick thanks to one old HPDP&#39;er who sent me a very kind note last week encouraging me to continue reminding all of you brethren just just how central to the very fabric of our existence the Ex President is! Some now familiar new faces have been returning this year and recreating some of that old spirit and I&#39;d like to mention them here just in case you all thought this was just about Pete! Old salts like Stella, Spider, Phil, Dean, Dan, Dave and Col, the Beardies (Justin and Phil P) and Geoff, some genuine locals with a great sense of fun and a delight to have around. And relative new comers who are settling into the bad habit of Wednesday nights like Owen, Louis, Chris O and Dave G. And finally the uber barman, Drew, the guy who keeps the cheer flowing.</p>
<p>See you all and maybe then some next week.</p>
