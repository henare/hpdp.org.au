<p>John provides us with one of his now-almost-weekly inspirational messages:</p>
<p><i>Dear pool friends,</p>
<p>Ringmaster Garth has returned from his fact finding mission in the Eastern block. Hardly refreshed after stepping off the plane in the early hours of the morning he not only reclaimed his ringmaster crown but went on to secure his first win of the reconstituted comp. Bastard! Justin remains the points leader, but not by much. As you already know the Nick Power Cup commences next week. Ben, the current holder of the goose riding midget will bring the revered object itself next week to get your collective juices flowing. And finally, I&#39;m sad to have to report that the HPDP slipped from its regular first place in the Trivia to a very disappointing second, however I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a glitch. Don&#39;t forget to check the pool ladder at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/" target="_blank">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Yours,<br />
JL</i></p>
