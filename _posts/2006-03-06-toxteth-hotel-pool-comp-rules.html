<p>In light of some continued problems with outside players engaging in questionable play during the comp, there was some discussion on the HPDP mailing list regarding rules about this behaviour. Our comp organiser, Phil, has provided a definitive list of rules for this week&#39;s comp:</p>
<p><i>Hi All,</p>
<p>The following rules will be displayed and adopted for this week&#39;s pool comp.</p>
<p><b>Toxteth Hotel Pool Comp Rules</b></p>
<p>1.         1 shot rule.</p>
<p>2.         Honest attempt at own ball.</p>
<p>3.         If big and small balls are potted off the break, then the breaker is on the first to fall. It is then the opponent&rsquo;s shot.</p>
<p>4.         If the white ball is potted or leaves the table, the white ball must be played forward from the line.</p>
<p>5.         The black ball is to be placed on the spot when racking at the start of game.</p>
<p>6.         Missing the black or hitting an opponent&rsquo;s ball first is not loss of game. Any other foul on the black is.</p>
<p>7.         If the black ball leaves the table it is loss of game.</p>
<p>8.         Any other ball leaving the table will be replaced on, or as close as possible to, the spot.</p>
<p>9.         In the event of a dispute the competition organiser may declare a winner or a re-rack.</p>
<p>10.       The organiser&rsquo;s decision is final.</p>
<p>11.       The winner of the game will rack the balls for the next game.</p>
<p>Deliberate snookers and the potting of opponent&rsquo;s balls is discouraged in the interest of a friendly game.</p>
<p>Phil</i></p>
