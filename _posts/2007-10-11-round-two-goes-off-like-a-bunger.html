<p>Outrageous claims from John in this update of round two the NPC:</p>
<p><i>Dear pool friends,</p>
<p>What a difference a week makes! A full card and some fierce competition as the Lords of the Deep Brown battle it out for supremacy. I&#39;m giving the Most Improved award to Peter T for his valiant effort against buyback Garth in the final and the most Disappointing Attempt on the Black award to Henare. Dan remains the NPC points leader, but only just! See you all for the final confrontation next week. See it all now at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>JL.</p>
