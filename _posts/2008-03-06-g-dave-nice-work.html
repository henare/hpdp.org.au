<p>John writes in with his congratulations...</p>
<p><i>That&#39;s right folks, an inaugural win for the tireless Dave G last night. Congratulations. A tight 16 comp with no buybacks. Sadly, no one is approaching Peter T&#39;s 64. Come on dudes! Welcome freshies for 2008 Tom J, Joey, Harry and Yvonne (nice boots!)</p>
<p>JL.</i></p>
