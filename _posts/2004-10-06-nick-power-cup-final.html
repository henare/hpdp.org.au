<p>Well, tonight&#39;s the night. Another thrilling, nail-biting finale to the Nick Power Cup.</p>
<p>The bookies are nervous... the odds are going wild... the contenders are pacing anxiously in the gates... the punters are roaring with excitement in the stands... ahhh, where was I again?... must be the caffeine.</p>
<p>So, is it going to be Gozzo (66), Jo (54) or Jink (34) to have their name added to the prestigious list of NPC winners? Or could it be Phil (61), Dean (42) or perhaps even yours truly (at 29, a definite underdog, so plentiful support from the eager fans is expected) to have the honour of having their name twice on the coveted trophy?</p>
<p>We&#39;ll just have to wait and see as the third and final stage progresses this evening. Come one, come all and make it the special event it always is.</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone!! May your balls be with you (errr... non-sexist remark intended).</p>
