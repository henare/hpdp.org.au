    Peter T replys...

    "Phil,

    Great summary. Well done.

    However there is a slight discrepancy in the attendance stats as I haven't missed a single comp this year. The discrepancy is due to the fact that we didn't record the results of the last game at the Toccie as it was invalid. Therefore we have only 46 out of 47 comps recorded (altho I have been at all 47). The same principle will apply to the other stats you listed.

    Don't we wanna have a comp on the 22nd Dec?? Hey, it is my birthday and, as is customary, I should be allowed to win :)

<p>As the end of the year and the end of the &#39;04 comp draws near Phil updates us on the state of play...</p>
<p>"With 3 rounds to play (assuming we play the last one on 15/12 and not 22/12), Col needs to win at least 2 of the remaining comps and he CAN catch Ben for the title (Ben currently leads by 32 points - so it isn&#39;t all that likely). Well played to both of them, as they do have 1st and 2nd tied up between them. ..."</p>
<p>Read on for <a href="/phpws/index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=18">More</a>"Third spot closely contested between PT and myself - half a point separates us.</p>
<p>JL has a chance of breaking into the top 5. Currently in 8th spot, 30 points adrift of Dean in 5th spot, John would need a very strong close, with at least two wins from 3 comps. Dean&#39;s leg also doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing him down too much (he beat me last night :-(), so John&#39;s work is cut out for him.</p>
<p>Special mention and thanks to Xavier for supporting the comp so strongly last night with 3 buybacks.</p>
<p>PT would appear to have the attendance record sown up, on 46/47 appearances, Mond 45/47 and Ben and myself on 44/47. Col, JL, Jase, Spider have all racked up (pun intended) over 40 appearances, and Karina and Dean are on 39 and 38 respectively.</p>
