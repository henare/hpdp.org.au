  content: the drawer( whether for comp or buybacks)should be done, where possible,
    by a disinterested person thereby eliminating possibility of a rigged drawer.

  content: I'd just like to point out that the current comp is run by Al, and as such
    he will have the final say on buybacks. Suggest we discuss with him.

<p>There are a number of issues that continually get raised in relation to the pool comp rules. The most current of these is the way that buybacks are handled. Set rules are required in order that the buyback process is fair to all.The only suggestion we have received to date is from Jo:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Anyone arriving BEFORE 20:30 gets a place directly (obviously if<br />
there are any available)</li>
<li>Anyone arriving AFTER   20:30 has no rights at all (unless there<br />
are loads of spaces)</li>
<li>Any first round loser is eligible for a buy-back.</li>
<li>The draw should be made when all other first round games have been played (and not before)</li>
</ul>
