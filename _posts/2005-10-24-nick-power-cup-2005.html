<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>It is now actually past that time of year (September), but it IS the time of year that the 2005 NPC is being organised.</p>
<p>Dates are tentatively proposed as the 9th, 16th and 23rd of November.</p>
<p>Reasons/excuses it was not held in September:</p>
<p>1) School holidays prevent some regulars from attending<br />
2) I was away<br />
3) I have changed jobs, and only just got access to HPDP emails again (if this gets through ;-) Thanks Henare).</p>
<p>I am not planning on heavily promoting the NPC in the pub. The people to whom it is important will know, and I see no reason to encourage blow-ins with the idea that there is more on offer for these three weeks - there is only pride - not prizes.</p>
<p>On a related note, due to recent differences of opinion expressed over the pool table I am trying to get a list of rules to be put up in the pub (possibly only for Wednesday nights even). The following are up for discussion:</p>
<p>1) Honest attempt at own ball.<br />
2) 1 shot rule.<br />
3) If the white ball leaves the table, opponent must take next shot from the line and shoot forward.<br />
4) If any other ball leaves the table, it shall be returned to the spot or as close as possible.<br />
5) A player may miss the black ball. Any other foul on black is loss of game.<br />
6) Deliberately sinking opponents balls and "tap" snookers are considered foul shots (see rules 1 and 2).</p>
<p>Anything I need to clarify, add or remove? <i>[Make a <a href="/phpws/index.php?module=comments&#038;CM_op=makeComment">comment </a>or email the list]</i></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Phil Ryan<br />
P.S. It is worth noting that unpopular though it is, a new record has been set. Brian Budd has now won the last 5 weeks in a row, beating Ben and Josh&#39;s records of 4, and making Pete&#39;s once unattainable 3 in a row look like old news. See rule 6 above for a clue to some of the differences of opinion that have been vioced.</p>
