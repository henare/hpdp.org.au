<p>Despite the editor lamenting the use of a big H and last week&#39;s shunning, please read on for the latest update...</p>
<p><i>How very nice to have a second 32 comp in a row. Things are looking very exciting. And I&#39;m pleased to say that Peter T didn&#39;t win (just for a change) but he remains firmly fixed on the top rung. Dean, the quiet achiever, is now in second place.  And a very special mention of our very good friend H, who managed to make an appearance (albeit, after the comp was nearly over).  Hopefully we&#39;ll see last nights new comers, Ben, Julian, Googa, Joe, Simon and Darryl next week.</p>
<p>Good things to you all,<br />
JL.</p>
