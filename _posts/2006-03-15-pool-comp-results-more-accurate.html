<p>Our dedicated Comp organiser, Phil, writes:</p>
<p><em>Hi All,</em></p>
<p><em>Please find attached more up to date pool comp results for this year. I made a few errors in calculating the previously distributed results (notably that Brian has won only one comp this year, not two).</p>
<p>I have only added complete details for semi final placings or better for the last few weeks - but almost up to date data is now on <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">the website</a>....</p>
<p>PT remains our leader - even on the updated numbers (and is the only multiple winner this year)!</p>
<p></em></p>

<p>A table of the current standings....</p>
