<p>John provides a wrap up of the NPC:</p>
<p><i>Dear pool friends,</p>
<p>Peter T (building on his current most improved status) rocketed to the top of this years NPC final last night. So well planned was his ground campaign and exit strategy that he was declared cup winner before the completion of round three. However, the sweetness of his victory was slightly soured when he was denied the opportunity to join the hallowed ranks of this years pool comp winners by yours truly in the same round. Dan, the sentimental favourite, was unable to secure his position in round two, opening the way for Pete&#39;s shock n awful performance. The plucky little freedom fighter Henare, despite having missed the first week of the campaign, secured fourth position in the cup ranking. Well done chaps. Keep your eyes on the emails for an announcement on the inaugural Magnificent Sevens Invitational coming soon to a licensed premises near you. Catch a glimpse of the cup ceremony at <a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Yours,<br />
