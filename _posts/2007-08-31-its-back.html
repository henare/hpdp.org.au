<p>John provides our first announcement in just over a year!!</p>
<p><i>Dear pool friends,</p>
<p>The cyberstats are back. After an absence due to a few world wars your favourite community web link is back on air. Just navigate to www.hpdp.org.au and click on <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">Pool Comp Stats</a>. We had a 16 player comp on Wednesday with no buy backs. This is great news. Let&#39;s make it 32 next week. And if you think greed is good its $100 for first and a case of Hahn Premium for second (tax free). I want to make a special call to arms to all you girls out there, a bit of chick stick wouldn&#39;t go astray (thanks Kat for your attendance).</p>
<p>JL.</i></p>
