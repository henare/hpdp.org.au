<p>On Wednesday afternoon the hpdp.org.au mail server went down, affecting all inbound and outbound mail from hpdp.org.au. This also affects the mailing list.</p>
<p>I have left the machine offline pending an investigation of the cause. I will recover the machine as soon as I get a chance, hopefully this weekend.</p>
<p>Please don&#39;t hesitate to post any questions as a <a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/phpws/index.php?module=comments&#038;CM_op=makeComment" title="Make a Comment">comment</a></p>
