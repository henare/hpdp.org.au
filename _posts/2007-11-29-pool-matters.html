<p>John&#39;s action-packed update follows:</p>
<p><i>Dear poolies,</p>
<p>The Hatfields and McCoys had a riotous time last night with Geoff clawing his way to the top in one of the few 32 comps so far this year. All the action at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Bye for now!<br />
JL.</i></p>
