<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/2011/10/greetings-to-all-felicitations-to-all-nick-power-cup-2011-attendees/nick_power_cup-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-717"><img class="size-medium wp-image-717 aligncenter" title="Nick_Power_Cup" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Nick_Power_Cup-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="134" /></a>Last night saw the first night of the most-anticipated and revered sports event in our entire planetary system plus a bit past Alpha Centauri, around the corner and take the first laneway on the left, the <strong>Nick Power Cup</strong> (2011).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As usual, the event was surrounded by the usual awe, glamour and glitz as the stars of the pool industry were out in force to show their support and take a crack at winning this most-coveted of prizes. The HPDP film crew were enthusiastically buzzing and swarming to capture the play and gain exclusive interviews with celebrity players whilst the huge and ever-growing, eager audience waited impatiently for the show to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what a night of pool it was although with some early shock disappointments and clear displays of match nerves. Proving that the mystical fire and passion the NPC brings out are truly powerful forces not to be easily dismissed, current 2011 champ, <strong>Roelof</strong>, succumbed in the first round securing a mere <strong>7</strong> points out of the maximum 32 on offer (16-player comp). <strong>Peter T</strong>, currently second placed on the 2011 ladder, fared better by going on to the semis and claiming a solid <strong>21 </strong>points towards his aim of having his name etched for the <strong>4th </strong>time on this most-adulated of trophies. NPC newcomer, <strong>Ozzie</strong>, managed to secure 2nd spot with <strong>29 </strong>balls sunk on the night. A disappointing 1st-round loss was also experienced by the NPC 2010 dark horse 2nd place-getter, <strong>Henare </strong>(7pts).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Full marks (<strong>32</strong>) go to <strong>Lee</strong>, who shone through to take out the night and put himself firmly at the top of the NPC 2011 ladder. Lee's form has been sporadic over the years, this being best highlighted when comparing last night's result to his last year's NPC placing of 23rd equal (13pts total). Excellent work, Lee. I would like to personally nominate you for <strong>Most Improved Player 2011 - NPC Category</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the ongoing 2011 pool comp standings, current leader, <strong>Roelof</strong> (190pts) added just a single point to his total last night whilst 2nd place-getter, <strong>Peter T</strong> (154pts), further whittled away Roelof's lead by another 3 points. Highlighting the critical importance of attendance in actually gaining any points, the absence of <strong>John L</strong> (96pts) last night meant that <strong>Lee</strong> (109.5pts) was able to steal John's undefended 4th place whilst also closing in rapidly on <strong>Dean</strong> (113pts) in 3rd. This year's countdown to the grand final appears set to being a nail-biting photo-finish once again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The table below shows all the current standings in the NPC 2011 ladder. With two more weeks of jockeying for top position to go, anything is possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related topic, as you will no doubt be aware, the NPC is currently being filmed by the HPDP film crew (Chick Stick Productions) for eternal safe-keeping of memories. Edited scenes will be made available on the <a href="../" target="_blank">HPDP website</a> once Herr Direktor, <strong>John L</strong>, has applied his incredible talents and magical mystical trickery to the editing process. This leads into the next point which alludes to the requirement for "absolute bucketloads of that magic" to be applied...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any general queries in regards to this footage (particularly that on the night of Wed 12 Oct 2011) or any issues arising from any mishaps and/or technical problems that may have been encountered, should be directed to the "nominated" (following a unanimous retrospective vote-of-confidence in his abilities on the night) temporary director, -->> <strong>Jink</strong> <<--. All liability for any of these aforementioned complete and utter f*ups has been absolved on all other involved, irresponsible parties. Good luck, Jink!! We're right behind you (at a very safe distance!!)... on behalf of all those other irresponsible parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May the chick-stick (a.k.a. girlie-stick, seafood-extender) never be with you!!<br />
[Apologies to all females (including those who should be), feminists, wowsers and big girls' blouse users of chick sticks for what is clearly a highly sexist but humourous reference to a well-established industry standard measurement of one's pool 'girliness' [Apologies: refer to disclaimer for 'chick-stick']]<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Peter T</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Following a query last night, it should be pointed out that NPC points are <strong>NOT</strong> awarded for buyback games i.e. only your <strong>first attempt </strong>ball count will be included.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Don't forget to regularly check for updates on here for always-enlightening news, current events, video clips and rib-shattering humour at its very very best!!</p>
