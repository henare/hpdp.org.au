<p>John rouses:</p>
<p><i>Comrades,</p>
<p>I&#39;m thrilled to announce the first of what will be a full year of competition commencing tomorrow, Wednesday 9 January at 7:30pm at the <a href="http://www.haroldparkhotel.com.au/">Harold Park Hotel,</a>. There is an exciting new development with the two tables being moved to the northern end of the upstairs level. This should make for a comfortable evening for all comers. Look forward to seeing you all there. With respect to last year, whilst we have not made the final update to the 2007 <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">stats</a>, I believe it&#39;s safe to congratulate Dan with his unassailable position on points. Congrats mate.</p>
<p>Love at ya,<br />
John.</i></p>
