<p>Harold Park Displaced Persons (HPDP) The HPDP is an organisation established by former regulars of the Harold Park Hotel, Wigram Road, Glebe, in 1998. It was formed in order to keep its members in touch following the closure of the hotel. The pool competition has been running since 1987 having been initiated by Dean Smith at the Harold Park Hotel. The pool comp is still running every Wednesday night despite multiple changes in venue. Since the HP closure, we have used several different venues: Headquarters Hotel Ancient Briton Hotel Toxteth Hotel Casey&rsquo;s Hotel Toxteth Hotel again After a 6-month break from the Toxteth following interference by the hotel management in the running of the HPDP pool competition, we have returned to the &ldquo;Toccie&rdquo;. This was as a result of an approach by the management requesting our return and the ensuing successful negotiations on mutually-agreeable terms. Each year in September, the Nick Power Cup is held over a 3-week period. This is held in memory of Nick Power, a close friend to many HP&rsquo;ers, who died suddenly in 1998. This is further proof that the HPDP is a close-knit group of like-minded individuals who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company irrespective of location.&hellip;</p>
