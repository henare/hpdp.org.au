<p><em>Update: The <a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/2011/11/high-jinx-caption-comp-1-winner/">winner has been announced</a>!</em></p>
<p>Here's the latest High Jinx gag but this time there's a difference... there's no caption.</p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/2011/11/high-jinx-caption-comp-1/antelopegag/" rel="attachment wp-att-740"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-740" title="High Jinx Caption Comp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/antelopegag.png" alt="" width="563" height="345" /></a>This morning the cartoonist had a silly thought - instead of using his idea for a caption, why not put it out to the ever creative HPDP community?</p>
<p>So here's the deal, <a title="leave a comment" href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/2011/11/high-jinx-caption-comp-1/#respond">leave a comment</a> with your suggested caption and next Wednesday the 9th of November the winner, as judged by the artist, will be announced (so you better get along to to the comp!). The winner will have their caption digitally etched into the cartoon and it will be posted here on the HPDP site.</p>
