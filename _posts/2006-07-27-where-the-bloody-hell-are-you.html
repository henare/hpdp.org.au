<p>Phil writes in with a couple of announcements:</p>
<p><i>Hi All,</p>
<p>A number of pool comp announcements are due.</p>
<p>1) Where the bloody hell are you???</p>
<p>Those of you who HAVE been there will know that attendance has slipped badly. We have averaged 8 or more buybacks for over a month now, and last week I only ran a 16 person comp (twice as it turned out). Hopefully warmer weather and the approach of the 2006 Nick Power Cup will generate better attendance.</p>
<p>2) Nick Power Cup</p>
<p>I propose the dates of 13, 20 and 27 September. DEAN - how&#39;s that trophy engraving going?</i></p>
<p>And read on for the latest <a href="index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=40">pool comp standings</a><i>3) Pool Comp standings</p>
<p>Rank ~ Name ~ Points ~ Wins ~ 2nd</p>
<p>1 ~ BRIAN BUDD ~ 105 ~ 7 ~ -</p>
<p>2 ~ PT ~ 101.5 ~ 4 ~ 3</p>
<p>3 ~ PHIL ~ 80 ~ 3 ~ -</p>
<p>4 ~ COL ~ 74.5 ~ 2 ~ 3</p>
<p>5 ~ ROELOF ~ 64 ~ 1 ~ 2</p>
<p>6 ~ CHRIS ~ 45 ~ 1 ~ 2</p>
<p>7 ~ GEOFF ~ 44.5 ~ 1 ~ 2</p>
<p>8 ~ DANIEL T ~ 37.5 ~ - ~ 2</p>
<p>9 ~ DEAN ~ 37 ~ 1 ~ -</p>
<p>10 ~ JL ~ 33.5 ~ - ~ 1</p>
<p>Well done PT - surpassing the 100 point mark for the year - and almost equal to Brian. Well done JL - racing into the Top 10.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all next week.</p>
<p>Phil</i></p>
