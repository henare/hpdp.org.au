<p>John announces the Nick Power Cup with this update:</p>
<p><i>Dear Pool Friends,</p>
<p>Last night we saw the first 32 comp at the new HP. And I&#39;m pleased to say that old warhorse Gozzo made his first appearance and took home the $100. Not bad for a bloke who hasn&#39;t picked up a stick for six months. A glance at www.hpdp.org.au will show Ross and our new recruit Jason equal first on the ladder. In response to Phil&#39;s email, week one of the Nick Power cup will be on Wednesday 3rd October and will be played over three consecutive Wednesdays. For those of you who don&#39;t know, the NPC involves scoring 10 points for each win, with a point for each of the winners balls sunk going to the loser of each game. At the end of week three, scores are tallied and the winners name engraved on the coveted Nick Power Cup. Prize money is as usual. First in first served.</p>
<p>Yours in deep blue,<br />

<p>And Peter clarifies the situation on the scoring system for the NPC...</p>
<p><i>...And well done, John, re the NPC. However, the NPC scoring system is not as you say.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#39;s a point per ball sunk. Therefore, if you win a game it&#39;s 8 points. A win is always 8 points regardless of how it was won e.g. premature eblackulation by your opponent still means 8 points for the win even if you sunk no balls. The winner of the comp on the night scores 40 points (32 player comp = 5 games won) or 32 points (16-player = 4 games won).</p>
<p>The loser of any game scores a point per ball sunk. A loser can only ever make 7 points max even if they sunk the black as it was obviously a foul if they lost the game.</p>
<p>Hope that clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>Peter T</i></p>
