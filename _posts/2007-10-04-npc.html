<p>John outlines the first week of the NPC:</p>
<p><i>Yes, pool lovers, an exciting start it was. Dan took out line honours with the chance that the cup may find its way into the NP blood line this year. Enjoy the ride vicariously at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>. Click on "Nick Power" after navigating to the pool stats.</p>
