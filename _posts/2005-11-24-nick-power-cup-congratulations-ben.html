<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>On behalf of the HPDP I offer my congratulations to Ben Spiers, the deserving winner of the 2006 Nick Power Cup, after 2 successive weeks making the final.</p>
<p>The third week of the NPC (last night) coincided with a celebration of the 30th birthday of Daniel and David (Nick&#39;s nephews). It was great to see Julia and the boys, and a fine celebration was had by all.</p>
<p>I do wonder what time today we stopped though....</p>
