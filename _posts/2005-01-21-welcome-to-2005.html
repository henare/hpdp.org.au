<p>Welcome all to the new year, hopefully you have recovered from the excesses of Xmas &#038; NYE. Remember to check our Ben&#39;s stats site for details of the <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/ladder.cfm?year=2004&#038;week=0">2004 Comp</a>.</p>
<p>All the servers also had a break over the holiday period as they were physically moved and moved to a new ISP. We would apologise for the inconvenience, if anyone used the site.</p>
<p>Read on for details of the <a href="/phpws/index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_id=19&#038;ANN_op=view">2005 SuperComp</a> proposed by our comp organiser PhilHi HPers,</p>
<p>This is a belated communication regarding a proposed addition to our pool competition. Informal discussions with many of you have gained a significant level of support (with none yet against), but in the interests of informing everyone, this &#39;official&#39; communication is being issued.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that we maintain the records for a "super" competition, with a $500 prize at the end of the year for the player with the best NON-buyback results.</p>
<p>1) Competition will be based on the weekly results of the current competition.<br />
2) Winner will be the player with the best 20 results for 2005, NOT counting buy backs.<br />
3) Prize money to be $500 made up of $10 per week withheld from the weekly prize money. (I see this as the only possible sticking point - reducing our weekly prize by $10, although we do not have a fixed prize amount anymore).<br />
4) I believe a tie is unlikely, but in that event, I suggest a system of playoffs (using balls sunk ala Nick Power cup if required) to narrow the field to a single winner. If a mutually agreed system of playoffs can not be agreed by the tied parties, then the winnings shall be evenly divided. (If two players, I suggest a best of 3, and work from there).<br />
5) As organiser of the comp I will manage the collection of prize money for the end of the year.<br />
6) In the unlikely event that we are forced to relocate again, if possible this arrangement to continue at the new venue. If not, the current leader will take any prize money collected to that point.</p>
<p>On the basis of widespread support $10 was withheld from the prize money of last week&#39;s competition. If that support does not meet any objections from the wider group, we will simply continue. If objections are raised which can not be over come, I will return the $10 from last week to the winner of last weeks comp - yours truly ;-).</p>
<p>Thoughts are welcome. Your presence tonight even more so. See you there.</p>
<p>Phil</p>
