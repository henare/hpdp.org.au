<p>Hail rain and sunshine, the mix couldn't dampen the enthusiasm of John and Col, food judges at the recent annual Bush Tucker Day at Trundle (pop: 600) in outback NSW.</p>
<p><a href="/phpws/index.php?module=announce&amp;ANN_user_op=view&amp;ANN_id=10"></a>It was a task and half tasting 68 dishes including pigs head, rabbit, kangaroo and yabbies, though their two beautiful female co-judges made the task that much easier.</p>
<p>Erietta also attended as an assistant to the adjudicator. Thanks as well to Eri for the photos. Accomodation at the Capell sheep and wheat property 14 km out of Trundle was wonderfully mind altering and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Can't wait till next year!</p>
