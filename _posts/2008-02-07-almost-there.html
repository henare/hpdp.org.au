<p>John serves up an exiting message...</p>
<p><i>Yes, we were close to a 32 comp last night. So get down early and often! Newbie Mond found himself in the final, but was kept out of 1st position by Dean. Peter T is still comfortably atop the ladder. All the action at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
