<p>John hints in vain...</p>
<p><i>Hello sleepy heads,</p>
<p>It&#39;s the weekly intrusion on your inbox here. I guess there&#39;s still somebody out there so I&#39;ll keep reporting until the food runs out. Anyway, another 16 comp last night with freshie Mick T taking out the title. There were some old familiar faces there, not playing pool but just having a jolly nice time with the Harold Doctor. So let that be a hint!</p>
<p>Yours most sincerely,<br />
JL</i></p>
