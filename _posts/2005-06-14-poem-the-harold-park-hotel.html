<p>Read on for <a href="/phpws/index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=25">Fran&#39;s award-winning poem</a>...<b>The Harold Park Hotel</b></p>
<p><i>Fran Davies</i></p>
<p>What&#39;s become of the H P Hotel, to the locals that haunted the place?</p>
<p>Not the suits that breezed in on a Friday night for the trots or to pick up a case</p>
<p>Gone are the days of the old pool comp that gathered people from near and far</p>
<p>I wonder what happened to old Jetboy who had his own seat by the bar</p>
<p>I hear Marty went back to Ireland , there&#39;s no shortage of pubs over there</p>
<p>But I still see Carol round the traps, pushing uphill in her chair</p>
<p>And Nick, well he didn&#39;t make it, though he put up a mighty fight</p>
<p>So we said farewell to a local with the pub overflowing that night</p>
<p>Serge now works for the opera and Dean has moved nearer the sea</p>
<p>A beer garden once so crowded is now completely pot-free</p>
<p>The carpark is filled with rubble, the sign gone from above the front door</p>
<p>The poets, the muses and comics will stand on its stage no more</p>
<p>There are plenty of pubs in Sydney , but the Harold was one of a kind</p>
<p>No matter how far you would travel I&#39;m certain just couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p>The kind of mates we made there, some have lasted a decade or more</p>
<p>It was a refuge to many a traveller and those who were new to our shores   </p>
<p>Yes, they&#39;ve closed the old HP Hotel but there are many who still hope in vain</p>
<p>The doors will swing open wide and long to welcome old mates once again</p>
