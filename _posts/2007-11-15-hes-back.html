<p>John provides another feisty update:</p>
<p><i>Dear "Like I could give a rats arse about the pool comp" chums,</p>
<p>Sorry about the tardiness of the updates but there was a slight technical hitch in data sharing after the management takeover. Ben and Peter T have actually edged yours truly out of 5th into 7th place, congrats boys. As always the action and the progressive ladder can be viewed at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Ciao for now,<br />
JL</i></p>
