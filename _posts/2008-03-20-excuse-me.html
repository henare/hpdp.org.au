<p><i>Just thought you&#39;d like to know that Peter T and Dean lost in the first round. They told me to tell you that actually. Not that it&#39;s just about the pool eh H? The exciting bit is an an ex HP freshie arrived tonight, Nathan X. Used to drink there in the olden days. And now he&#39;s doing a PhD in Philosophy. And who said that pool was the road to ruin? Oh. yeah, and Justin was fucking excellent tonight - I swear. But, he decided to go the high risk, high return route ... and lost! Oh, and H wears army boots.</p>
