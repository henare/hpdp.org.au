<p>COMMUNITY SAFETY ANNOUNCEMENT<br />
- UNSAFE GLEBE STREETS -<br />
Glebe, 6 March 2008</p>
<p>This is to advise that Sydney streets, in particular those in Glebe, may be subject to serious disruption and safety concerns. Whilst ongoing roadworks on Glebe Point Road are currently caused some safety issues, a new threat to public safety has just emerged.</p>
<p>It has been announced today that Drew Sullivan (barman, Harold Park Hotel) passed his driving test this morning. As a result, all pedestrians are advised to take extreme care when crossing roads or even walking on the footpath. Please assume that nowhere is safe. The elderly and infirmed are particularly vunerable.</p>
<p>Drivers should show a heightened level of vigilence and continuously check rear-vision mirrors and side streets for any signs of hoonish and reckless driving indicating the possible presence of Mr Sullivan. Should he be observed driving, he should not be approached and immediate steps taken to protect yourselves and then to advise relevant authorities.</p>
