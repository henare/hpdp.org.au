<p>As this week appears to be HP Poetry Week, <a href="/phpws/index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=26">here&#39;s another</a> submitted by Jack</p>
<p>Peter T<b>Harold Park Hotel</b></p>
<p>Theatre of gold<br />
Fresh with talent<br />
and yet so old</p>
<p>First here as a boy so long ago<br />
Now a sad farewell<br />
The final show</p>
<p>It&#39;s touched us all near and far<br />
From the back of the garden<br />
through to the bar</p>
<p>The names, the faces the unearthing of stars<br />
Battlers and winners<br />
now treasure their scars</p>
<p>The magical aura where memories  abound<br />
Art be romantic<br />
If romance be found</p>
<p>Thirteen years to the month a slice of my life<br />
Not a single regret<br />
Richer for the journey</p>
<p>Space is running low like time itself<br />
They say we must move on<br />
The almighty dollar shrouded in lies<br />
Once again moving us along</p>
<p>John T. Carroll 2/10/99</p>
