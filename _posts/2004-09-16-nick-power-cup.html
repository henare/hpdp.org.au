    Here are questions that have been raised on the list, and the answers from subsequent discussions.

    Q: <b>Do balls sunk during buyback games count?</b>
    A: Absolutely NOT!!!

    Q: <b>What happens if you sink one of your opponents balls?</b>
    A: Your oponent will get the credit for it. In other words, at the end of each game it's the number of <i>your</i> balls down that counts for your points. NOTE: Mauro offers the wisdom that if you sink your opponents ball, and it's the black, you lose the game (Ed: Glad we cleared that one up)

    I also understand that the winner of the game always receives 8 points, regardless of how many balls they sunk to win. If someone can confirm this please post a comment.

    I'm not sure that's a verbatim quote Henare, I'm sure what I said was:

    "Everyone enjoyed the day out with a jolly good walk between taverns, hosted by our gay host Gay. Some of us were a little tipsy at the end, but gosh, you've got to let your hair down sometimes. I for for one will be making every effort to join in again next year."

<p>The Nick Power Cup starts<br />
Wednesday 22nd Sept 7:30pm at Casey's Hotel.</p>
<p>That's next week!</p>
<p>For those of you new to the NPC or just can't remember, <a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/phpws/index.php?module=announce&amp;ANN_user_op=view&amp;ANN_id=7">read on</a> for the rules</p>
<p>Peter TThe rules are simple:</p>
<p>1. Point are scored over the next 3 Wednesdays (Sep 22 &amp; 29, Oct 6).<br />
At the end of the game, the winner is awarded 8 points while the loser<br />
starts with seven and deducts from that the number of his balls left on the table.</p>
<p>2. The person with the most points at the end of the third<br />
Wed wins the prestigious and coveted <a href="http://hpdp.org.au/phpws/images/photoalbum/4/Nick_Power_Cup.jpg" target="_blank">Nick Power Cup</a>.</p>
<p>3. After each game you must tell Al the number of balls you sunk<br />
during the game. It is YOUR responsibility to remember to tell Al.<br />
Please make sure that your points plus those of your opponent<br />
only add up to a maximum of 15 points per game.</p>
<p>Could you please ensure that everyone who may not be on the<br />
mailing list or may not check the website, is informed about the NPC.</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone! Let the games begin!</p>
<p>Peter T</p>
