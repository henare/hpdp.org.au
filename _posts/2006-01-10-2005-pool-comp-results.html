<p><i>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Happy New Year to you all. I have finally updated the last few weeks of pool comp results for 2005. Top 10 in the final standings are:</p>
<p>Rank ~ Name ~ Points</p>
<p>1 ~ BRIAN BUDD ~ 208</p>
<p>2 ~ PHIL ~ 192.5 (Only one comp win behind D&#39;oh!!!)</p>
<p>3 ~ PAUL Z ~ 144</p>
<p>4 ~ COL ~ 123.5</p>

<p><a href="index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=34">Read on</a> for more juicy details...Another consistent year from regular top 5 finishers Col, Dean, PT, Ben and yours truly - only Brian and Paul keeping Dean and PT out of the Top 5 again. Good work Ben, given you missed almost half the year.</p>
<p>The Best 20 weeks Comp finished as follows (Brian played 19 weeks, Paul played 15):</p>
<p>1          PHIL               169</p>

<p>3          BEN                82</p>
<p>4          DEAN             68</p>

<p>14        HARRY            25</p>
<p>15        ALISTER          24</p>
<p>16        GEOFF             22</p>
<p>17         XAVIER          17</p>
<p>17         LAURIE          17</p>
<p>19         JOHN              15</p>
<p>I will be there for a comp tomorrow night. I understand there was even a 24 person comp run on the 28/12 - but I wouldn&#39;t know anything about that.</p>
<p>Oh - special mention to Jo Proctor who made it to 48 out of a possible 50 comps. PT, Mond, Dean, Roelof, John L and Col all also managed to rack up more appearances than I did (42 - thanks to Dean and Col who ran the comp in the weeks I couldn&#39;t be there).</p>
<p>Wishing you all a great 2006,</p>
<p>Phil</p>
