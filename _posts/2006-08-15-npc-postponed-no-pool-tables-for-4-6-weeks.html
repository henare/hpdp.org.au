<p>Phil alerts us to the following newsflash:</p>
<p><i>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Please find below a transcription of a letter I received last night from Simon at the Toxteth, as a result of which the 2006 Nick Power Cup is postponed indefinitely subject to confirmation of dates AND VENUE.</p>
<p>I would introduce it by stating that Simon was most apologetic and understanding of our position (namely that this is a completely unacceptable way to be treated). Simon himself was only informed on Monday as I understand things, and only becuase he pressed the issue  with his "superiors".</p>
<p>I say this in an effort to have any dissatisfaction addressed to senior Toxteth management via the bar staff and management rather than to the people we see every day. The lack of notice appals me, but I (we) have seen such a thing first hand at the Harold.....</p>
<p>Note that this affects not only the pool comp, but pool playing at the Toxteth full stop for the period of renovations. As such over the next week I will be divesting myself of accrued toccie $ with whoever I see there. I will find somewhere else to go (at least in the short term), as I like to play pool with my beer....</p>
<p>Bring on the Harold Park....</p>
<p>So...... EVERYONE COME ON DOWN THIS WEEK!!!! It will be the last pool comp for at least a few weeks, and possibly one of the last held there.... The HP will not open in 4-6 weeks, but it must in 4-6 months.....</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

Wednesday pool competition - postponement<br />
Dear Phil,<br />
This letter is with regret to inform you that as of Monday 21st August 2006 the Toxteth Hotel will be removing the pool tables for the purpose of Hotel improvements (renovations). It is unsure how long the renovations will take but we anticipate 4-6 weeks.<br />
I hope that once the work is complete that you will continue to play your (my emphasis) Wednesday competition here at the hotel.<br />
Thank you for your understanding in this matter and your patronage.</p>
<p>Simon Hovermann<br />
Venue Manager<br />
Toxteth Hotel.<br />
