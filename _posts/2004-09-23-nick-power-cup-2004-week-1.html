<p>Well, the 1st stage of the 2004 Nick Power Cup went very well last night with a very good attendance level and some excellent pool being played. With most of the current top scorers in the regular comp being relegated to the scrap heap in the 1st or 2nd rounds, it was up to the likes of Gozzo (37 pts), Jo (29) and Dean (28) to clean up in the points tally.</p>
<p>Well done, guys!! It&#39;ll be on for young and old next week then.</p>
