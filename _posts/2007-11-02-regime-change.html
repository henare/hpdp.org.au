<p>Read on for John&#39;s insightful update:</p>
<p><i>Dear Pool Friends,</p>
<p>As a result of regime change, a large contingent of mercenaries were seconded to do battle at the comp on Wednesday. This resulted in the third 32 comp of the year, ending well after closing. There has been some shuffling of the leader board (always a good sign) and congratulations Dan on his third win of the season (must be rigged?!?). And note the *new improved* $130 prize money. Check it at <a href="http://stats.hpdp.org.au/">www.hpdp.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Yours in Deep Brown,<br />
JL</i></p>
