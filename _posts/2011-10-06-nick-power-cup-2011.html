<p>Greetings and felicitations fellow HPDPers!!</p>
<p>This is to confirm that the <strong>2011 Nick Power Cup </strong>starts next week:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wednesday 12th October 2011 @ 7:30pm</strong></span><br />
</span><br />
and continues on <strong>Oct 19</strong> and <strong>Oct 26</strong>. Please make sure you let everyone know about this most special and prestigious event, the highlight of the HPDP calendar, respected and revered around the Glebe, the Globe and the beyond. As is customary, the final week will include the time-honoured NPC handing-over ceremony (if necessary) to the new champion by the current holder... oh that's me! :P</p>
<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Beware of unscrupulous scalpers selling closing ceremony tickets at exorbitant prices. See Dean in the laneway for more reasonably priced tickets including those covered under your standard, gold or platinum <strong>Cash4Pool</strong> membership plans ;)</p>
<p>Also, it is my special honour to be able to take this opportunity to wish our very own forever lovable, forever furry, forever grumpy John L a <strong>very happy birthday</strong> for today. Let's hope that still more age may begin to mellow him yet. Commiserations also to more-grumpy-than-usual John for just missing out on a special birthday eve pool win last night against Kidi in the final. Obviously those extra 364 days have allowed John to show some improvements in this area at least. Well done, John!!!</p>
<p>Last night's results have already been posted (reflecting the new more-streamlined assignment of responsibilities as detailed in last week's ermailing). Little has changed in the top placings, with the exception of <strong>John L</strong>'s thrilling late points-grabbing dash. <strong>Peter T</strong> managed to claw back a single point from the seemingly unstoppable juggernaut <strong>Roelof</strong> after disappointing, lack-lustre displays from both last night, which left some in the vast audience baying for an immediate refund. It is hoped that the NPC may further inspire not only these two players but all players possessing the burning desire to have their name engraved on the most coveted of all pool trophies in the known galatial neighbourhood, the <strong>Nick Power Cup</strong>.</p>
<p>See y'all at next week's NPC kickoff. Good luck to all. May the best man/woman/[insert other options] win!!</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
Peter T</p>
