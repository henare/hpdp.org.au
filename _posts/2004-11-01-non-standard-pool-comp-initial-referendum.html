<p>All, </p>
<p>We need to make a fairly urgent decision on the issue of non-standard pool comps. It is very possible that this Wed night could leave us in the same situation as last week should the attendee numbers be that low again.</p>
<p>So here are what I see as the basic issues that we need to address. Please consider these and contribute to the online discussion (forget work, it&#39;s a Monday after all). If these questions are agreeable to all, we will post a poll on the website with the view to resolving this prior to Wed night.</p>
<p>Unlike with John L&#39;s favourite namesake, Little Johnny, we shan&#39;t be confusing the referendum question by tying complex conditions to a fairly basic question and therefore guaranteeing the result.</p>

<a href="http://www.hpdp.org.au/phpws/index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=15">Read more</a> details on the surveyNON-STANDARD POOL COMP REFERENDUM</p>
<p>1. Should we allow 16-player comps at all? Yes/No</p>
<p>2. Should we allow 24-player comps at all? Yes/No</p>
<p>3. Should ANY non-standard game (i.e. not 32 players) qualify for points distribution? Yes/No</p>
<p>4. If we do allow non-standard comps to earn points, should we:<br />
         a. allocate full points (i.e. 16 pts for 1st, etc),<br />
         b1. allocate half points (i.e. 8 pts for 1st, etc) - 16-player comp<br />
         b2. allocate 75% points (i.e. 12 pts for 1st, etc) - 24-player comp, or<br />
         c. use some other form of scoring which may be more fair?</p>
<p>And another question remains which may be more difficult to decide upon. It may require that we use a one-off solution this Wed should we find ourselves in this situation.</p>
<p>5. If we allow 24-player comps, how do we decide the 2 finalists? Suggestions requested.</p>
<p>I also think it fair that whatever is decided here is retrospectively applied to last week&#39;s game. The only other option for last week is to use the existing precedent which means that, as a non-standard comp, no points will be awarded.<br />
____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Well, actually there is one more relevant question:</p>
<p>6. Should we allow John L to continue playing in the comp as we need to keep a certain minimum standard of play?<br />
         a. yes, cos he&#39;s improving and he&#39;s so lovable,<br />
         b. no, cos I never liked him anyway, or<br />
         c. only if he buys us all a drink (after Mauro has, of course)</p>
