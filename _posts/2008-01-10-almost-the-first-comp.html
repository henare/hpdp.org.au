<p>John laments...</p>
<p><i>Well,</p>
<p>As those of you who attended know the first comp failed to get off the ground last night due to a malfunctioning table. However, there was much merry making playing "Round the World" on the offending object. Barring a similar event next week,  the first comp is now scheduled for next week. So come on down!</p>
