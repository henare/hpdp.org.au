<p>Peter provides a comprehensive update on the venue seach for the HPDP pool comp...</p>
<p><i>Ladies and gentlemen and others,</p>
<p>Firstly, sorry for the waffly email but it all needs to be said.</p>
<p>We have to make some sort of decision soon on the pool venue, especially if we want to be able to hold the Nick Power Cup this year. I think the following appear to be the latest updates in terms of potential venues. Please correct me if my memory fails me over the issue of... ummm.. what was it again?</i></p>
<p>Read on for the full <a href="index.php?module=announce&#038;ANN_user_op=view&#038;ANN_id=42">discussion paper</a>...<i><b><u>VENUE UPDATE</b></u></p>
<p><b>Toccie</b> - out of action for officially 4-6 weeks, unofficially 4-6 months based on the men&#39;s toilet renovation fiasco. The front pool bar is now intended to be the bottle shop. Under this arrangement, it appears unlikely that there will be an area allocated for pool tables anyway (unless they&#39;re planning on putting them in a portaloo caravan out the back as they tend to do during their renovations). With the inevitable construction delays plus the reconfiguration of the place, I&#39;m suspecting the Toccie is going to be a non-starter for pool for the short or medium term.</p>
<p><b>HP</b> - not opening till Dec. Unknown as to how many, if any, pool tables will be there. Obviously, the preferred long-term choice. Needs contact with new management to find out situation (ACTION ITEM)</p>
<p><b>Kauri</b> - one pool table so only lends itself to a 16-player comp or will need about 5 hours for a 32-player comp so a Wed night may not be possible unless it&#39;s a real early start (or staggered start depending on ppl&#39;s availability). It has been suggested that we ask the mgmt if they&#39;ll get another table in... or indeed we do or at least subsidise a temporary additional pool table (how much does a pub pool table cost to rent?). Fairly large groundswell of support for the Kauri as a preferred venue. (ACTION ITEM)</p>
<p><b>AB</b> - has the tables but doesn&#39;t have many of the other basic necessities for a pub in terms of customer service, etc. And besides, it was confirmed by Roeloff that they are definitely not interested in another pool comp. They currently hold a comp on Tuesday nights.</p>
<p><b>Roxbury</b> - 3 tables on upper mezzanine level. Wed night they have a comedy night but this is in a function room on the mezzanine level. I confirmed with the pub that the pool tables are available for use on Wed nights. I didn&#39;t confirm whether we could reserve the tables for the comp, however, I&#39;m sure if we had the numbers, they&#39;d do a deal. Maybe we&#39;ll be able to reserve 2 of the 3 tables at least. (ACTION ITEM)</p>
<p><b>Doghouse (Casey&#39;s)</b> - 2 tables, $2.50 schooners, 2 far and 2 much of a doghouse for many. The "been there, done that" attitude seems to prevail on this one.</p>
<p><b>North Annadale</b> - ??? No idea. Dean might be able to add some detail about the pub and the church across the road... ooops ;) (ACTION ITEM)</p>
<p><b>PT&#39;s Deck (please ensure pronunication is correct)</b> - yes, well this has been the most common suggestion. It involves either moving the Toccie&#39;s pool tables as well as most of the furniture across the road or simply hiring/making/stealing new tables. This will solve the Toccie&#39;s storage problems, will solve a major problem for us, but will, however, give my cleaning lady an apoplexy on Thurs mornings when she arrives... oh sorry, Thurs afternoon... or is it sometime next week.. maybe. The management of the Level 1 Club has decided against this option for reasons of public safety and IR issues concerning contract labour ;) (NON-ACTION ITEM)</p>
<p><b>Somewhere Else</b> - the sponsor of this suggestion was informed that Somewhere Else went out of business many years ago when we stopped going there on Wed nights after the HP closed.</p>
<p><b>Anywhere Else</b> - ???</p>
<p><b><u>NICK POWER CUP</b></u></p>
<p>Apart from finding a venue for the NPC, we may need to address other issues relating to who and how many play in the NPC this year.</p>
<p>Dean made a suggestion that we do a 16-player comp at the Kauri this Wed. That&#39;s a good suggestion in my book. However, the only problem is determining who plays in the NPC. We do have more than 16 players who still turn up regularly and would want to play in the NPC. So what criteria do we use to reduce the numbers? Did the person have to have been a mate of Nick or at least have known him? Or does simply being an HPDPer qualify someone?... err but does that mean all those on the mailing list for example cos there&#39;s heaps of them and many didn&#39;t know Nick or go to the HP.</p>
<p>Or maybe it doesn&#39;t matter cos general apathy will limit the number of people who turn up on Wed nite and everyone might get in... if we have enough for 16 even.</p>
<p>Suggestions have been made that the NPC could be run on, say, a Sunday arvo thus allowing enough time to run a 32-player comp. Any thoughts on that idea?</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#39;s get something sorted guys! Can you all please pass on this information to others who may not be on the mailing list... thanks.</p>
<p>At this stage, I think the general feeling is to meet at the Kauri tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Peter T</i></p>
