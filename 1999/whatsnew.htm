        <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000" size="2">Last Wednesday's continued polling saw the NO vote - stop visiting other pubs - move into a comfortable lead. 14 of the 24 votes are in favour of settling into a pub, whilst 8 prefer to check out other pubs and 2 are undecided. The overwhelming majority of punters have tipped <i>The Headquarters</i> as the preferred long term base.
<p>
In a surprising piece of last minute negotiation, a compromise was reached between the YES and NO camps which will see the <i>North Annandale</i> as the venue for next Wednesday night (17 Nov). This is probably a fair result in that the <i>NA</i> was on the original list of potential venues, however, was missed from the fax sent to local pubs.
<p>
Unless the <i>NA</i> proves to be a more suitable venue and reverses the opinions of the majority of punters, it seems most likely that <i>The HQ</i> will end up being the preferred venue as from the following Wednesday (24 Nov). It has leapt into the lead with a 66% majority (on 1st and 2nd preferences). The <i>Friend In Hand</i> has emerged as the second preference with 17% of the vote. This is followed in 3rd place by the <i>Harold Park</i> obviously supported by diehard <i>HP</i> regulars.<p></td>

Of the 14 people polled, 7 are in favour of continuing visiting other pubs, whilst 7 are in favour of stopping the search. Of those wishing to stop, there is a strong leaning towards the <i>Headquarters</i> as the preferred permanent venue.<p>

Amongst those who wish to continue visiting other pubs or ones already visited, the <i>HQ</i> is favoured (4 votes) with the <i>North Annandale</i> next (3) followed by the <i>Friend In Hand</i>, <i>Australian Youth</i> and <i>Forest Lodge</i> all with 2 votes each. Further referendum details can be found on the <a href="venues.htm">Venues<a> page.<p>

This equal division of opinion caused by different factions obviously vindicates the need for a formal poll. A potential spin-off of this factional in-fighting is the fragmentation that may occur as a result. For this reason, it is suggested that everyone completes a <a href="venues.htm">referendum questionnaire</a> and forwards it to the returning officer prior to next Wednesday night.<p>

Owing to the strong support to date for the <i>HQ</i> and a "general agreement" last Wednesday, the <i>HQ</i> is the proposed venue for next Wednesday night.<br></td><td align=left width="70">&nbsp;</td>
